# Xueying

## Plan of Last Week

- help to write code

---

## This Week's Work

- Build the e=Environment of ETM with the help with Yiming
- try ptrace() but failed.
  - pt_regs VS. user_pt_regs
  - PTRACE_ATTACH failed with unknowable reason
- Many programs can be found that use ptrace() for code injection, but most of them are implemented under x86.

---

## Last Week's Plan

- Continue work on ptrace
