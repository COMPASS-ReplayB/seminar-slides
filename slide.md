# Haonan Li

## Plan of Last Week

- Syscall capturer: handle more and more syscalls...
- Paper writing: revise & rewrite
- Make pressure experiments for my syscall capturer

---

## Progress

- Syscall capturer: add support for `poll/epoll`
  - Finish _all_ (almost) syscalls used in nginx: `recvfrom`, `openat`, `sendfile`, `epoll`
- Paper writing: revise & rewrite
  - rewrite subsection: _Desgin-Challenge_ and desgin for my syscall capturer
  - _catch up with Zhenyuâ€™s proofreading_
- Make fomal experiments
  - delayed to today & tomorrow
  - setting up environment... as we found we should run in SSD
  - Wenxuan: _why not directly mount and write to SSD_
  - environment: finished by last night

<!-- ---

## Epoll

- `int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout)`
- `events` represents `array` of `struct epoll_event`
- The length of array (the part further used by user) is `return value`
- **Variable-length array!** -->

---

## Syscall Types

- **Scheduling related**: e.g., `wait` and `nanosleep`, we simply ignore
- **Change State of OS**: e.g., `epoll_create` and `chroot`, ignore again as it will not affect the user's program
- **Get form OS**: e.g., `getpid`, `getcpu` and `getcwd`, record its return value and memory region change
- **Input**: e.g., `read` and `recvfrom`, truncate their contents
- **Output**: ignore again

## Plan for Next Week
