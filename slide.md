# Haonan

## Plan of Last Week

- Prepare for baccalaureate defense (Jun. 3)
- Try to Conduct a demo for auto code generation... (GuGuGu)
- Learning something about library fuzzing (...)

---

## HOW to perceive the interrupt?

### ReVirt: OSDI'02
x86 processors provide a hardware performance counter that can be configured to compute the number of branches that have executed since the last interrupt [Int01]

## Library Hook: Importance, Challenges, Solutions

Challenge:

- Impractical to neglect the library, due to the tremendous size of ETM result
- Preloading every functions is ugly (*but might be acceptable for specific functions*)
- Need to distinguish deterministic functions (e.g., `sqrt` 100M times needs less than 1s)
- Some Challenges in watchpoints...
    - A function can write a memory region for many times...
    - How to handle `void*****`
    - But the watchpoint still din't run successfully

Some other thoughts:

- Need further study on librarys
- Multi-layer structure: complicated optimization only for most common cases

## Some ... Other Responsibilities

- I was assigned to RISCV-TEE Group
    - I am a person focused in Arm, why suddenly appointed to RISCV?
    - But Zhenyu told me: the boss has studied and decided
- Schedule for next period:
    - Work with Mingde, depoly their work on our new board
    - Migrate berkeley boot loader to openBSI + uboot 



# Wenxuan

## Plan

Due to our meeting, I have two main targets:

1. using PMI to help collect ETM log periodicly.
2. Implement a Replay Machine for online tracing stage.

## Interrupt handler in kernel

Much easier than register a interrupt handler in ATF.

```c
unsigned long irq_flags = IRQF_PERCPU 
                 | IRQF_NOBALANCING 
                 | IRQF_NO_THREAD 
                 | IRQF_SHARED;
request_irq(irq_id, pmu_irq_handler, 
            irq_flags, "pmi_handler", 
            (void*)pmu_irq_handler);
```

## Tips on handle interrupt in kernel

### Interrupt Mapping
- Interrupt ID in kernel (logic interrupt ID) is different from the hardware interrupt ID.
- Logic interrupt ID is not always adding a simple offset.
- Linux kernel remains logic interrupt ID 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 for PMU in Juno board r2.

### Exclusive Handler
- Normally an interrupt can only have one handler.
- Unless that irq_flag contains `IRQF_SHARED`.

---

## Register a co-existing handler 

After everything is set up, our kernel module successfully handles PMI.

## One more question: why use interrupt mapping?

- Interrupt Controller => IRQ Chip => Multi-level Interrupt Controller
- multi IRQ Domain (where IRQ handler takes effect)
 
### Mapping Models

- Linear Mapping. `irq_domain_add_linear()`, map similar interrupts together. (e.g. our Arm PMI)
- Radix Tree Mapping. `irq_domain_add_tree()`, use hardware id as lookup key in the radix tree. (e.g. MIPS hardware)

---

## Replay Machine

Since we got a ridiculous score from the professor ...

### Experiment

Replay a simple binary with no *non-deterministic* factors.

---

## Experiment

This is the control flow we reconstructed before.

![](images/control_flow.png)

---

## Construct

- disassemble
- use ETM output to locate code blocks
- collect "waterfall" control flow

We consider the "waterfall" control flow unacceptably large. We are going to construct a block dynamically.


## Re-Execute

. . .

Segmentation fault.

### Registers
- The initial state of registers are different.
- Store and restore registers (user space context switch).

### Sections
- Origin data, bss memory section are not copied.
- Copy static memory sections like data and bss.
